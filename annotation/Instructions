>>>>> Introduction <<<<<
This instruction is prepared as a guide to annotating our dataset
for research purposes.

The dataset we are working with contains existing research papers
are in the form of text files (.txt). In this data gathering
session, we will focusing on citations and references.

Before we begin, you should have the following files:

	1. annotations_[id].txt (E.g. annotations_[43].txt)
		This will be your main working file.

	2. sample_annotation.txt
		This file contains several sample annotations.

	3. Sample research papers (E.g. A00-1001.txt)
		These files are the respective files related to 
		sample_annotation.txt

	3. Several research papers for your use (E.g. A22-1234.txt)
		These files are for your use during this session.

What you need:

	1. A text editor with line number display.
		You might be familiar with Notepad++ (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
		Otherwise, Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

In the file, annotations_[id].txt, you should see something like this ->
		A00-1032==>C92-4173
		A00-1032==>C94-1032
		A00-1032==>J97-2002
		A00-1033==>J95-2004
				:
				:

Each line is defined as a 'cite'. i.e. A00-1033==>J95-2004 refers 
to the paper A00-1033.txt citing the paper J95-2004.txt. Notice
the direction of the arrow, '==>'. [Paper A]==>[Paper B] refers to
Paper A making reference to some information in Paper B.

For example, in Paper A, one of the paragraph might contain this:

"....implicitly contains lemma-tization. Disambiguation selects the
most plausible sequence of lexemes by a use of a rule-base model or a
hidden Markov model (HMM) (Manning and Schiitze, 1999). Disambiguation
is already language independent, since...."

Notice "(Manning and Schiitze, 1999)". This is Paper A making
reference to Paper B, in this example, written by the authors
Manning & Schiitze in 1999.





>>>>> Objective & Definition <<<<<
The objective of this data gathering session is to gather
manual annotations for our research. We wish to annotate whether
a citation is "general", "specific" or "bad".

A "general" citation simply means Paper A is citing Paper B in
general. Paper A is making reference to Paper B as a whole, or
simply giving credit for the work done by authors of Paper B.

A "specific" citation means Paper A is making reference to a
specific section of Paper B. For instance, Paper A makes reference
to a particular system, System ABC, created/described by Paper B
in Paper B's second section (e.g. Our System). Since Paper A is
specifically referring to this section of the paper, we say this
cite is specific.

In some cases, a research paper's text file might look like this:

	<Start of Document>
	189
	190
	191
	based tagger by inferring rules from a training corpus. However,
	current implementations of the rule-based tagger run more slowly
	than previous approaches. In this paper, we present a
	finite-state tagger, inspired by the rule-based tagger, that
	operates in optimal time in the sense that the time to assign
	tags to a sentence corresponds to the time required to follow a
	single path in a deterministic finite-state machine. This
	result is achieved by encoding the application of the rules
	found in the tagger as a nondeterministic finite-state transducer
	and then turning it into a deterministic transducer. The resulting
	deterministic 
	<End of Document>

This is an example of a "bad source". In worst cases, the file
contains only lines of numbers. These are actually page numbers
of research journals, but no need to worry about that for now.
So in any case when either Paper A or Paper B is in this form,
we define it a "bad" cite.





>>>>> Let's Annotate <<<<<
Let's use the same example: A00-1033==>J95-2004
From this, we know that A00-1033 cites J95-2004 (Let us now refer
to A00-1033 as Paper A, J95-2004 as Paper B).
The information we want to capture is, which type of cite this
is: "general", "specific" or "bad".

Annotations are captured in lines of 4 "columns":

	Cite 	|	Specific?	|	Location	|	Bad?
	
Cite: 		Simply the provided cites (E.g A00-1033==>J95-2004)
Specific?:	[yes/no]. To determine whether the cite is specific
Location:	[line no./null] To capture where is the info.
			Line no. look like this: L20-35.
Bad?:		[yes/no]. To capture whether it is a "bad" cite

Here's how some annotations might look like: 

	A00-1031==>P98-1081,yes,L64-138,no
	(This example says it is a "specific" cite, found at line 
	64-138, and it is not a "bad" cite)
			:
	A00-1004==>P93-1002,no,null,yes
	(This example says it is not a "specific" cite, a "general"
	one. Has no specific location, so 'null', and it is a "bad"
	cite)
			:
	A00-1004==>P94-1012,yes,L16-26!!L204-205,no
	(This example, L16-26!!L204-205, means it is "specific",
	and the info comes from 2 location in Paper B. Notice how it
	is annotated with 2 exclamation marks (!!) )

OK! Let's get started!
