\paragraph{}
Citing previously published scientific papers is a necessary and common practice among researchers. It gives credit and acknowledgement to original ideas, and to researchers who did significant work in a particular field of research, and more importantly, upholds intellectual property. A reader of such research papers often encounters these citations made by the authors in various sentences throughout the paper. Often enough, if a reader wishes to gain a better understanding of the current context, it is necessary to follow through these citations and read up on these cited papers. Readers would also be interested to know where the information is in the cited paper.

\paragraph{}
However, as frequent readers might find, most citations are only \textit{mentions}. They do not directly refer to some particular section of the cited paper, for example, to make reference to the evaluation results made by the authors of the cited paper. Instead, they are general citations. These citations are equally important. But since it is not immediately clear where the cited information is from, a reader has to invest additional time to read through the entire cited paper before being able to find out what or where the critical information is.
%Tao: You may put some of the survey results in Steven Wan's paper, to show the importance of studying citation provenance.  

\paragraph{}
%Tao: "and" is more formal than "&"
In general, we wish to improve the reading experience of scientific \& research documents, from the various fields of research. Readers will be informed of where exactly the cited information is from in the cited paper. We aim to be able to identify which section or paragraph in the referenced paper is the source of the information referred to in the citation, i.e. Citation Provenance.

%Tao: You need to state the novelty of your work. E.g., the  second work that tackle this problem, and the advantage of your work than Wan's work. 
 
%Tao: A paragraph is needed to summarize the structure of the following report.
