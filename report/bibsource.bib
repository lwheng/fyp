  abstract = {Practitioners and researchers need to stay up-to-date with the latest advances in their fields, but the continual growth in the amount of literature available makes this task increasingly difficult. In this article, we describe the Citation-Sensitive In-Browser Summariser (CSIBS), a new research tool to help manage the literature browsing task. The design of CSIBS was based on a user requirements analysis which identified the information needs that biomedical researchers commonly encounter when browsing through academic literature. CSIBS supports researchers in their browsing tasks by presenting both a generic and a tailored preview about a citation at the point at which they encounter it. This information is aimed at helping the reader determine whether or not to invest the time in exploring the cited article further, thus alleviating information overload. Feedback from biomedical researchers indicates that CSIBS facilitates this relevancy judgement task, and that the interface and previews are easy to use and informative.},

  abstract = {We present a new keyword extraction algorithm that applies to a single document without using a corpus. Frequent terms are extracted first, then a set of cooccurrence between each term and the frequent terms, i.e., occurrences in the same sentences, is generated. Co-occurrence distribution shows importance of a term in the document as follows. If probability distribution of co-occurrence between term a and the frequent terms is biased to a particular subset of frequent terms, then term a is likely to be a keyword. The degree of biases of distribution is measured by the chi^2-measure. Our algorithm shows comparable performance to tfidf without using a corpus.},

  title = {Automatic Keyword Extraction from Documents Using Conditional Random Fields},
  journal = {Journal of Computational Information Systems},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {4},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {Keywords are subset of words or phrases from a document that can describe the meaning of the document. Many text
mining applications can take advantage from it. Unfortunately, a large portion of documents still do not have keywords assigned. On the other hand, manual assignment of high quality keywords is expensive, time-consuming, and error prone. Therefore, most algorithms and systems aimed to help people perform automatic keywords extraction have been proposed. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is a state-of-the-art sequence labeling method, which can use the features of documents more sufficiently and effectively. At the same time, keywords extraction can be considered as the string labeling. In this paper, keywords extraction based on CRF is proposed and implemented. As far as we know, using CRF model in keyword extraction has not been investigated previously. Experimental results show that the CRF model outperforms other machine learning methods such as support vector machine, multiple linear regression model etc. in the
task of keywords extraction.},
